# JBOOK Project

This is an interactive coding environment. You can write JavaScript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

All of your changes get saved to the file you opened JBOOK with. So if you ran `npx js-notes-cli serve test.js`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the test.js file.

* Open an new text or code cell by clicking on one of the buttons
* Click on any text cell to edit it
* The code in each code-cell is joined together into one file (if you define a variable in code-cell #1, you can refer to it in any following code-cell)
* You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the `show` function (this function is built into this environment)
* Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right
* Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell or after the last one

This project was built by attending the online course [React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/) by Stephen Grider.
